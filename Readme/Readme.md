#Myportfolio


I developed a portfolio website using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills and experience as a developer, and includes an interactive 3D model built with Three.js.

To create the 3D model, I used Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web. I also used HTML and CSS to design the layout of the website and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality.

The website is fully responsive, meaning it works well on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets. To ensure a smooth user experience, I optimized the website for performance, minimizing load times and reducing the file size of the 3D model.
